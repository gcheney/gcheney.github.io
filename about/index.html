    Currently, I work at <a href="https://wpengine.com/" target="_blank" class="link">WP Engine</a>. In my spare time I can be found working on new projects at <a href="https://github.com/gcheney" target="_blank" class="link">Github</a>, making new music on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/glencheney/sets" target="_blank" class="link">Soundcloud</a>, playing guitar with my amp turned up to 11, or listening to podcasts. A few of my favorites include <a href="//www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/" target="_blank">Hardcore History</a>, <a href="//www.npr.org/podcasts/510289/planet-money" target="_blank">Planet Money</a>, <a href="//99percentinvisible.org/" target="_blank">99% Invisible</a> and <a href="//www.radiolab.org/" target="_blank">Radiolab</a>. On the tech side of things, I often listen to <a href="//hanselminutes.com/" target="_blank">Hanselminutes</a>, <a href="//devchat.tv/js-jabber" target="_blank">Javascript Jabbers</a>, <a href="//softwareengineeringdaily.com" target="_blank">Software Engineering Daily</a>, <a href="//www.dotnetrocks.com" target="_blank">Dot Net Rocks</a>, <a href="//www.programmingthrowdown.com/" target="_blank">Programming Throwdown</a> and <a href="//www.fullstackradio.com/" target="_blank">Full Stack Radio</a>.

    After graduating from <a href="https://www.berklee.edu/" target="_blank" class="link">Berklee College of Music</a>, I spent four years living and working in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas"  target="_blank" class="link">Los Angeles</a> as a film composer and musician, and had the opportunity to work on quite a few <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3862321/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1"  target="_blank" class="link">interesting projects</a>. While I still enjoy <a href="https://soundcloud.com/glencheney"  target="_blank" class="link">creating music</a> and shredding some guitar, I am currently focused on my new found passion for programming, software development and the web. You can keep up with my latest work <a href="//glendoncheney.com/projects"  class="link">here</a>  and  read my thoughts on programming and code here on <a href="//glendoncheney.com/"  target="_blank" class="link">my blog</a>.
