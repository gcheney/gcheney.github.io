<p>I'm a full-stack web developer and film composer living in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas"  target="_blank" class="link">Austin, Texas</a>.</p>

<p>
    Currently, I work at <a href="https://wpengine.com/" target="_blank" class="link">WP Engine</a>. In my spare time I can be found working on new projects at <a href="https://github.com/gcheney" target="_blank" class="link">Github</a>, making new music on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/glencheney/sets" target="_blank" class="link">Soundcloud</a>, or doing coding challenges on <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/gcheney" target="_blank" class="link">HackerRank</a>. 
    <br /><br />
    After graduating from <a href="https://www.berklee.edu/" target="_blank" class="link">Berklee College of Music</a>, I spent four years living and working in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas"  target="_blank" class="link">Los Angeles</a> as a film composer, and had the opportunity to work on quite a few <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3862321/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1"  target="_blank" class="link">interesting projects</a>. While I still enjoy creating music, I am currently focused on my new found passion for programming, software development and the web. You can keep up with my latest work <a href="#projects"  class="link">here</a>  and  read my thoughts on programming and code at <a href="http://glendoncheney.com/blog/"  target="_blank" class="link">my blog</a>.

<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
